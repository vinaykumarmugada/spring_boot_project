ORM, JPA, and Hibernate—three key concepts in Java for database interaction:

1️⃣ ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
Definition: A programming technique to convert data between Java objects (classes) and relational database tables automatically.

Why? Without ORM, you have to write complex SQL queries and manually map database rows to Java objects and vice versa.

Example:

class User {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
}

This object can be automatically stored in and retrieved from a database table users.

2️⃣ JPA (Java Persistence API)
Definition: A standard specification in Java for ORM. It defines a set of interfaces and annotations for mapping Java objects to database tables.

It’s just an API, not an implementation.

Common annotations:

@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String name;
}

JPA does not manage the database itself—it needs an implementation to work (like Hibernate).

3️⃣ Hibernate

Definition: The most popular implementation of JPA.

Hibernate provides the actual code that manages database CRUD operations based on JPA annotations.

You write no or minimal SQL—Hibernate translates your object changes into database actions.

Hibernate supports:

-->Lazy loading
-->Caching
-->HQL (Hibernate Query Language)
